# Turing Route 66

Git repository for the assignment 'Touring Machines' for the course Simulation Tooling for the bachelor programme Artificial Intelligence at the HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht.

***
To run the simulation in the interactive webserver, the file `run.py` needs to be executed. This will open the webpage `http://127.0.0.1:8521/`

The plots belonging to the batch run can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook `Plotting.ipynb`.

To update the documentation, the command `make html` needs to be run. The documentation can also be viewed on [Read The Docs](https://turing-route-66.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "readthedocs.io").

Python 3.8.X is currently not supported. It is recommended to run the simulation in Python 3.6.x or 3.7.x.
