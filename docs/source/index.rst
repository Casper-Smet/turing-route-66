=============

To run the simulation in the interactive webserver,
the file `run.py` needs to be executed. This will open the webpage `http://127.0.0.1:8521/`

The plots belonging to the simulation and the batch run can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook `Simulation Analysis.ipynb`.

To update the documentation, the command `make html` needs to be run.

Python 3.8.X is currently not supported. It is recommended to run the simulation in Python 3.6.x or 3.7.x.
